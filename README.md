# dotfiles

Dotfiles that I use.

## Installation

> Note: The bootstrap.exclude.sh script creates symlinks from the dotfiles in this directory to the HOME directory. Make sure that your dotfiles are backed up somewhere safe.

Open a terminal and follow along!
1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:uroshren/dotfiles.git`
2. CD into the folder: `cd /path/to/dotfiles`
3. Execute the bootstrap script: `sh ./bootstrap.exclude.sh`
4. Restart your terminal or run: `source .bash_profile`
